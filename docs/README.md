## Project: Proving the Correctness of Rewrite Rules in LIFTâ€™s Rewrite-Based System
This web page serves as a record of the development process and results in the project.
Here is a list of things the developer is ~~struggeling with~~ interested in:
1. Formalising complex tensor operations in Agda
2. Pattern matching on `Vec`s with complex sizes, such as ` Vec t (sz + n * (suc sp) + (suc m) * suc (n + sp + n * sp))`
3. Agda `REWRITE` pragma
4. Proof irrelevence and without-K
5. Heterogeneous equality
