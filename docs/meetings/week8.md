# Week Seven Meeting
## Schedule
12 Nov 2019, 15:00 - 16:00

## Status
* Add `Record` for abstract commutative and associative operator with id element
* Finish refining `partRed`
* Finished refining reduce rule
* Finished first partial reduction rule

## Discussion
* In proving the last case of the second partial reduction rule, reasoning about the type of `Vec` is troublesome again because of Agda dependent type 

## Plan
* We need a better understanding of the `REWRITE pragma` to better structure the proof.
* The development of new proofs will be paused until 6th Dec.
