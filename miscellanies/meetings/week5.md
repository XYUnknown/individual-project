# Week Five Meeting

## Schedule
22 Oct 2019, 15:00 - 16:00

## Status
* Finished proof `splitJoin`
* Finished proof `fusion`
* Finished proof `simplification₁` and `simplification₂`
* Refined primitive semantics
* Started defining primitive `slide` and `reduce`

## Questions
* hints on tiling rule?
* the extra `t` in the type of `reduce`?
* `reduce` and `fold`?

## Discussion
* `slide` and tiling rule
    * `step` in slide should be > 0
    * specify the constraint of `u` and `v`
* `reduce`
    * prove `reduceSeq` first, `reduce` should be the same
* more rules in source code, fun to look at
